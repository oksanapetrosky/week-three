<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great similar projects available on GitHub; but I created this project to develop my skills with React. I love this project, because it's easy for the begginers and I think that one is not the last!

What is this project for:
* Your project will help you to understnd what is component's state and how it works
* Understanding state might helps you to develop your logic
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You also can use this project as an adding new daily task 

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
